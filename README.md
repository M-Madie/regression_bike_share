# Linear Regression - Bike Sharing data-set Project

This repository contains one of my first projects as a data science student taken from my student repo (copy of finalized files) - an exploration of the bike-sharing data set (https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand) and the development of a predictive model.

The repository includes the following files:
* task_bijeshare - an exploration of the bike-sharing data set
* task_bikeshare_pipiline - a script for running a linear regression model on the data set
