# Linear Regression - Bike Sharing data-set Project

This repository contains one of my first projects as a data science student - an exploration of the bike-sharing data set (https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand) and the development of a predictive model.

<ins>The repository includes the following files:</ins>
* **task_bikeshare.ipynb** - an exploration of the bike-sharing data set
* **task_bikeshare_pipiline.py** - a script for running a linear regression model on the data set
